      <h1>Design for Engagement</h1>

      <p class="sum">The goal of this project is simply to promote an interaction between a group of individuals who normally wouldn't interact and allow them to share something about themselves with others anonymously. This was achieved by presenting a series of questions in a physical space over the course of a month, allowing viewers to respond to these questions on a small piece of paper on the wall for everyone to see.</p>
      <p class="sum">The questions presented in the project were <a href="subject_a.html">"if you had one wish, what would that wish be?"</a>, <a href="subject_b.html">"when you were young, what did you want to be when you grew up?"</a> and <a href="subject_c.html">"what/who has inspired you in your life?"</a>. Responses to these questions varied from serious and sad to funny and ironic. After collecting all of the subject responses, a few dozen of them were published to this website under the subject tabs.</p>

      <div class="photos">
        <img src="assets/images/assembly.png" alt="assembly" class="photo"/>
        <figcaption>The exhibition was layed out in a simple grid structure on the walls at two locations.</figcaption>

        <img src="assets/images/full.png" alt="full" class="photo"/>
        <figcaption>A total of three questions were displayed for about 10 days each.</figcaption>

        <img src="assets/images/process1.png" alt="full" class="photo"/>
        <figcaption>Each question had a separate corresponding color to help visually promote the subject change.</figcaption>

        <img src="assets/images/process2.png" alt="full" class="photo"/>
        <figcaption>A hanging pencil encouraged viewers to write a response. After all of the responses were filled, the colored elements were replaced with the next subject.</figcaption>
